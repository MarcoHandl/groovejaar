The aim is to have a small client that can be a good alternative to the web service of grooveshark that, in certain cases , is really slow and require a lot of resources that make the grooveshark experience really annoying.\r\n \r\n \r\n## Build\r\n\r\nYou can download the source and compile all the project with the ant build file provided.\r\n\r\n\tant -f build.xml \r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nNo installation is required, all you need is the compiled version and the configuration files of the programs. For this reason you can consider GrooveJaar as a portable software.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n * Search songs\r\n * Fetch user playlist\r\n * Fetch top songs\r\n * Fetch songs from albums\r\n * Retrieve useful information for every songs searched like bitrate or size..\r\n * Multithread\r\n * Cover preview and download (if present on GrooveShark)\r\n * Possibility to listen a song without any type of download (also with queue support)\r\n * Add songs to your user lib\r\n * Add songs to your favorite music\r\n * Retreive lyrics of a song\r\n * Notify on new available update\r\n\t\r\n\r\n## Copyright Issue\r\n\r\nGrooveJaar provide the possibility to download the music stream of a song. Basically this can be viewed like a \"bad\" thing. But on Grooveshark you can find a lot of of free music, and if this music is free you can also download without problems!\r\nFor example take a look at this album [Quorum](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Quorum+web+album+/4709089), is released completly free so why I can't download ?\r\nOf course there're a lot of copyrighted songs but the software can't handle what is free and what isn't free. Also GrooveJaar don't provide nothing himself and you need to refeer to the [GrooveShark DMCA Policy] (http://www.grooveshark.com/dmca).\r\nIf you still think that this software have something that can lead a copyright owner just contact me and I will be happy to make all the modification to the source code that can avoid any type of problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug\r\n\r\nBefore report a bug check the [WIKI PAGE] (https://github.com/Ale46/groovejaar/wiki/GrooveJaar), if after reading the wiki you still think that you caught a bug make a [NEW ISSUE] (https://github.com/Ale46/groovejaar/issues/new).","name":"Groovejaar","tagline":"GrooveJaar is a Java based client for the GrooveShark service"}
