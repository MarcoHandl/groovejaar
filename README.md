GrooveJaar is written in **JAVA**, is **OPEN SOURCE**  and support Windows, Mac and Linux systems. The aim is to have a small client that can be a good alternative to the web service of grooveshark that, in certain cases , is really slow and require a lot of resources that make the grooveshark experience really annoying.

## Copyright Issue

GrooveJaar provide the possibility to download the music stream of a song. Basically this can be viewed like a "bad" thing. But on Grooveshark you can find a lot of of free music, and if this music is free you can also download without problems!
For example take a look at this album [Quorum](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Quorum+web+album+/4709089), is released completly free so why I can't download ?
Of course there're a lot of copyrighted songs but the software can't handle what is free and what isn't free. Also GrooveJaar don't provide nothing himself and you need to refeer to the [GrooveShark DMCA Policy] (http://www.grooveshark.com/dmca).
If you still think that this software have something that can lead a copyright owner just contact me and I will be happy to make all the modification to the source code that can avoid any type of problem.
